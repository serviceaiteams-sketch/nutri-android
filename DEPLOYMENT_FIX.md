# Heroku Deployment Fix

## Issue
- Heroku deployment failed due to package-lock.json being out of sync
- Added node-fetch dependency but lock file wasn't updated

## Solution
- Regenerated package-lock.json with `npm install`
- Added node-fetch@2.6.7 to dependencies
- Updated lock file includes all required dependencies

## Status
- ✅ Package-lock.json regenerated
- ✅ node-fetch dependency included
- ✅ Ready for Heroku deployment

## Next Steps
- Push changes to trigger Heroku rebuild
- Verify deployment success
- Test health analysis endpoint
